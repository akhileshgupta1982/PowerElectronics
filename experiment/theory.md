<p aligh = "justify">The circuit diagram of single phase half wave controlled rectifier with resistive R load and RL load is shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) respectively. This is the simplest form of controlled rectifier which consists of a single thyristor feeding DC power to a resistive load or inductive load.</p>
