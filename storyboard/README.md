## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1:To obtain the simulation of single phase half wave controlled rectifier with R and RL load and plot load voltage and load current waveforms.

### 1. Story Outline:

<p align="justify">The uses approaches to the simulator to understand the basic concept of firing angle and its use in half wave controlled rectifier. The simulator has six scroll buttons which are used by the user to control the different parameters. User scrolls the firing angle button to change the value of firing instant of the thyristor to control the DC value of output voltage. The resistance scroll button is used by the user to set the load resistance value of the circuit.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three generalized button for the whole button. User may use the V<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> scrolls button to zoom in or zoom out all the plots for clear visualization. User may use the average voltage and RMS voltage buttons for the calculation of corresponding values of output voltages.</p>


### 2. Story:

<p align="justify">The story is started with a character called thyristor. In our daily life we learn many thing with their pros and cons. Similarly, in this experiment we learn to control the output DC voltage by delaying the ON position of the thyristor. Here thyristor acts just like a switch which is used to obtain the average output voltage according to our needs. User initiates the process to delay the switch ON position by setting the value of firing angle. The whole story design process of simulation experiment is narrated as a story which consists of the description of the visual stage, the goals and objectives planned and the pathway set for the learner. Moreover a few challenges and pitfalls are also set to underline and emphasize the concepts involved in the experimentation. Every stage is described thoroughly in the following subsections.</p>

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Describe here : (guide When a user lands up into a simulator, the visual stage is the first thing that user comes across. The visual stage should include all the elements to be seen by a user on an imaginary canvas.  (This should NOT include any drawings. ) )

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas:
<b> 1.  For R Load</b><br>
<b>The average or DC value of the load voltage is given by: </b><br>V<sub>o,avg</sub> = V<sub>m</sub>/2&#120587;(1+cos &prop;)                                      (1)<br>
<b>The RMS value of the load voltage is given by: </b><br>V<sub>or</sub> = V<sub>m</sub>/2&radic;(&#120587;)   [(&#120587;-&prop;)+1/2(sin 2&prop;)]                (2) <br>
<b> 2.  For RL Load</b><br>
<b>The average or DC value of the load voltage is given by: </b><br>V<sub>o,avg</sub> = V<sub>m</sub>/2&#120587;(cos $\beta$-cos &prop;)                                  (1)<br>
<b>The RMS value of the load voltage is given by: </b><br>V<sub>or</sub> = V<sub>m</sub>/2&radic;(&#120587;)   [(&#120587;-&prop;)+1/2(sin 2&prop;)]                (2)

link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )
